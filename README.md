# TA-Segmentation-Corpus
We exploited corpora that exist for TA in order to propose a SBD system. We first carry out a set of preprocessing steps in order to clean, correct spelling errors, tokenise the words and identify sentences boundaries. 
We present an extract of the collected dataset. The entire corpus will be available when the project work is completed.
